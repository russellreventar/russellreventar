<p> Good day! Welcome to my personal footprint inside the world of the web. A direct impression of what I love to do left on the surface for you to explore. I am a computer programmer with a passion for design. Addicted to stringing together ideas and bringing them to life. Articulate problem solving and consistent learning is an everyday task I strive to complete.
</p>
<p>
I completed my Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computing Science from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology with a specialization in Digital Media. Throughout my undergrad I lived by the notion of making my applications both functional and usable. I pride myself in going beyond criteria to make projects presentable and professional. Obsessing over this practice has moulded me to completing top projects in the class and toward the path of becoming a better developer/designer. 
</p>
<p>
When i'm not coding or designing I enjoy keeping my articistic juices flowing through the medias of music and film. Simply put, I love to code, draw, sing and film things. Thanks for stopping by!
