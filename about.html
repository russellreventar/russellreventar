<p> Good day! Welcome to my personal footprint inside the world of the web. A direct impression of what I love to do left on the surface for you to explore. I am a computer programmer with a passion for design. Addicted to stringing together ideas and bringing them to life. Articulate problem solving and consistent learning is an everyday task I strive to meet.
</p>
<p>
I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Computing Science from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology with a specialization in Digital Media. Throughout my undergrad I lived by my notion of making my applications not only work but as well pretty. Going beyond the criteria and functional and technical requirements to make projects presentable and professional. Obsessing over this practice has moulded me to completing top projects in the class and toward the path to becoming a better developer/designer. 
</p>
<p>
When i'm not coding or designer I enjoy keeping my articistic juices flowing through the medias of music and film. Songwriting is a big part of my life and has been my go to therapy. Capturing and editing footage  has been a recent avocation of mine. Syncing the right sound with the correct visuals is an addiction. I plan to share original songs and videos in the near future.
</p>
<p>
And that's a short summary of what I love to do! I code, draw, sing and film things. Thanks for stopping by and be sure to look around!
