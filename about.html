<p> Good day! Welcome to my personal footprint inside the world of the web. A direct impression of what I love to do left on the net surface for you to explore. I am a computer programmer with a passion for design. Addicted to ideas. Pulling something from everything. The idea that anything we create is a regurgitation of everything we have experienced. Putting my own rendition into my work. I have been drawing and designing things way before i was able to stay within the lines. At a young age art was everything to me. around us  of new ideas and visions to share into and the of designing and developing it to is true living form. Work is the storm of ideas to creating something out of nothing. If there is one thing I know about myself within the 22 years, it is that when I am excited about something, when I am passionate about something, the extra mile turns into the next step, and I will do everything I can to take it and complete it. Nothing in this world is perfect, a project is either finished because of a deadline or beacuse features are met, but it never completed with perfection. But I believe it is how close
