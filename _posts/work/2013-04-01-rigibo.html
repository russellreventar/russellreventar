RigiBo-Puzzle is a project developed for the Simulation and Modeling course. Rigibo Puzzle is a simple 2D game where the player can explore the behavior of rigid bodies and how they interact with one another. The game forces the player to predict the movements of the rigid bodies ahead of time. The objective of RigiBo puzzle is to get the ball onto the wooden platform. This is done by strategically deleting the RigiBo boxes. A waiting timer is conducted when a body is destroyed to prevent the player from deleting all boxes at an instance.

The game simulation also contains a demo section that features Crates, Wheels, Friction and Flooding. These demonstrations focus on the different physics topics that are implemented into the project. The backend physics engine is responsible for motion (states,gravity,friction,thrust), collision detection and handling.
