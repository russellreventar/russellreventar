Mini Bizi is a Web Application that gives small business owners a platform to monitor their business. Development of this project finished in 2 months for my Senior Web Application course during my undergrad. Mini Bizi was also developed in conjunction to Lady Christine Baby Back Ribs Restaurant to be deployed as their main system in keeping track of all daily sales and other bussiness transactions.
