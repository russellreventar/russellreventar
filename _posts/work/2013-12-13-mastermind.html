<p>
Mastermind is an iOS software implentation of the classic code breaking board game. Developed for the Mobile Devices course during my undergrad, this game is a complete iOS application with customizable settings, high score tracking, game logic and main puzzle playing field. This project was my first application into the world of iOS. Picking up objective-C and learning Apple's respective API's, I designed the game interface and backend structure along with all the graphics and algorithms to run the game logic.
