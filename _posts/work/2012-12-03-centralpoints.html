<p>
Central Points is a web application developed for the Database Systems and Concepts course. It explores special purpose SQL and php. From design and construction of the data store to the backend/frontend, I was able to gain experience and apply concepts presented to real-life applications. The implementations of the application utlizes many concepts in database systems.

Central Points allows users to have all of their reward points from different organizations in one place. The database stores customer accounts with all card information and each companies reward program with their respective points syetem. Central Points' highlight feature is the ability to pool points together from different reward cards. Compabitable companies have the ability to offer their customers bonus rewards by earning points in all organizations.
