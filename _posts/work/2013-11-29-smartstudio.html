<p>
Smart Studio is an application designed for the Smart Table. This application is a digital audio workstation for DJs and recording producers. Designed and developed for Human-Computer Interaction during my undergrad, Smart Studio takes advantage of multi touch gestures and table top computings collaborative capabilities. This project is mainly focused on design and interface interaction. Providing prototypes that showcase user interface optimized for multi touch gestures and completing application tasks.
