<p>
Mini Bizi is a Web Application that provides small business owners a platform to monitor their business. A digital account for entreprenuers to keep track of sales, expenses and further progress their business. This project was completed in 1 month for my Senior Web Application course during my undergrad. Mini Bizi was also developed in conjunction for Lady Christines Baby Back Ribs Restaurant to be deployed as their main system in keeping track of all daily sales and other bussiness transactions.

This project explores dynamically-generated HTML, form submission and validation, session tracking and storing and retrieving data from a database. Mini Bizi applies MVC architecture, enforces current security practices and is designed with visual appeal and usability. Spotlight features of Mini Bizi are the ability to create user accounts, live watch company stock data and maintain records of sales, expenses and transactions. Mini Bizi automatically calculates yearly, monthly and daily profits.

	" Your project was best in the course.  It was very well written, professional, and production-ready. I think this project would make an excellent project for your portfolio, for when you apply for jobs.  As a former web developer myself, I know it would impress any hiring committee. The Computer Science group could deploy your project on a server, and use it as a demo for potential students at recruitment events "
